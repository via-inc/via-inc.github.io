First, purchase the amount necessary to replace your home, not your mortgage. Your coverage could be larger than the amount of your mortgage for several reasons including the cost of rebuilding.

Damages due to several types of natural disasters are not covered under standard insurance policies.

## Student/Recent Graduate Insurance

**I am a college student, am I still covered by my parents’ policies?**

It depends on the policy and its terms. For example, most Health insurance policies cover insured’s children up to age 18, or up to age 26 if the child continues as a full time student. If you are over 18 and not a full time student, you’ll need your own Health insurance policy.

**While I am in college is my personal property covered?**

Ask your insurance agent about special coverages available for this situation.
