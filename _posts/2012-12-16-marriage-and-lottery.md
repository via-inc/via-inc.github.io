A woman came home, screeching her car into the driveway, and ran into the house.

She slammed the door and shouted at the top of her lungs,...

"Honey, pack your bags. I won the lottery!"

The husband said, "Oh my God! What should I pack, beach stuff or mountain stuff?"

"Doesnâ€™t matter," she said. "Just get out!"
