**Americans Believe Technological Distractions Result in Poor Driving**

According to the new MetLife Auto and Home American Survey Pulse Poll, 85 percent of Americans said that cars are safer today, but just 29 percent think technology promotes safer drivers and almost 63 percent think current drivers are too reliant on technology feature to operate their vehicles.

The survey also reports that people favor convenience over driver and passenger safety when choosing technological features.

Results of the survey include:

- 90 percent of respondents were either very or somewhat familiar with GPS devices, which make finding your destination easier, but can take you attention off the road
- 77 percent were either very or somewhat accustomed to Bluetooth-style accessories, which make taking calls easier, but conversation can still be a distraction
- 27 percent indicated being familiar with in-car social networking, only a recent feature in certain car models. This number increased to 40 percent among Americans aged 18 to 34.

In contrast, when respondents were asked about their familiarity with more safety-oriented features, consistently fewer than half reported that they were very or somewhat familiar with various technologies. Results include:

- 44 percent of respondents were very or somewhat familiar with brake assist
- 43 percent were very or somewhat familiar with forward collision warning
- 28 percent were very or somewhat familiar with the lane departure warning
Less than half ( 42 percent) of respondents were very or somewhat familiar with electronic stability control. Almost one-third (31 percent) had never heard of it at all.
