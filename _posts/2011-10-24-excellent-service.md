Three insurance salesman were sitting in a restaurant boasting about each company’s service.

The first one said, “When one of our insureds died suddenly on Monday, we got the news that evening and were able to process the claim for the wife and had mailed a check on Wednesday evening.”

The second one said, “When one of our insured died without warning on Monday, we learned of it in 2 hours and were able to hand-deliver a check the same evening.“

The last salesman said, “That’s nothing. Our office is on the 20th floor of a tall building. One of our insured, who was washing a window on the 85th floor, slipped and fell. We handed him his check as passed our floor.”
