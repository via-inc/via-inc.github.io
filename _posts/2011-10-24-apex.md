Gordie Hard – A great insurance agent. An even better friend!

As I was leaving Gordie’s office after a meeting, I was involved in a pretty bad car accident at an intersection not far from his office. The first call I made was to Gordie’s office. Within 10 minutes, Gordie appeared at the scene. The young man that rear ended me was asked by the police officer to show proof of insurance and he had none. The officer asked me and I pointed at Gordie and said, “Here’s your proof!” Gordie then drove me to the car rental facility. Now that’s not just a great insurance agent… That’s a great friend!”
