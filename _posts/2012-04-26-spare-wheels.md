Spare Wheels is a group transportation company. We are actually (2) companies in one. One part of the company provides transportation for school districts and private schools. The other part provides adult transportation.

We now have 50 employees, 49 vehicles ranging from regular school buses to limo buses, 14 – 35 passenger coach buses, and vans.

**What is your ideal client?**

The ideal client could be a school district, a corporation, a wedding venue, park districts, or individuals.

We provide transportation for special needs students, field trips, sporting events, summer activities . The adult transportation is for weddings, sporting events, pub crawls, corporate transportation, senior citizen events, special events, church activities, prom trips.

Our motto is: _You Tell Us Where, We’ll Take You There._

**What have been the keys to success in your eyes?**

I believe our success is due to our passion for the service we provide, our commitment to integrity in all we do, and most of all God’s help.

**What kind of relationship do you establish with your customers?**

We strive to have an excellent reputation with all of our clients, rather it be school districts, businesses, or individuals.

**How do you maintain these relationships?**

We often send Constant Contact emails, visit our clients, follow up on services, provide extra benefits often.

**Have you noticed any trends in your industry at the moment?**

Large national companies have caused a price deterioration; harder to compete.

**What is the funniest story you’ve come across in your business?**

One of our drivers was downtown Chicago when his bus broke down. We had to have it towed and while Dennis was waiting for the replacement bus, he took all the coolers with beer (our client’s) and sat on the sidewalk waiting. Many individuals (probably homeless) surrounded him saying they would take the beer off of his hands, if he desired, at no charge. Dennis is also a minister, so when our manager drove up with the replacement bus and saw Dennis sitting on the sidewalk with his new friends, she couldn’t stop laughing.

**What is your greatest achievement?**

Continuous growth even in a time of economic downturn. Customer satisfaction has remained high with school districts and adult transportation. Our company has a very high safety rating.
