Friends,

I have recently completed a purchasing survey for my auto, home and umbrella insurance requirements and I thought that I would share the results with you should you be interested in doing the same.

As a starter, I predetermined that I wanted to deal with an insurance agency where I could have a personal relationship. I know that by purchasing insurance on the internet that you can bypass the middle man and get the lowest cost, but I have always highly valued service and personal relationships.

I requested quotations from seven different agencies. I disqualified one agency prior to quotation, two never responded to my request and four agents submitted a combined total of seven different quotations. I received quotes from agents for Safeco, Central Insurance, State Farm, Travelers, The Hartford and Pekin Insurance. FYI, Geico was one of the agencies that failed to respond. While this was not an exhaustive review, I do feel that it was representative.

As near as possible, all of the quotes were for the same level of coverage.

Price was not the only criteria for my decision process and I very heavily weighed customer service (poor customer service was the reason I disqualified one agency before they issued a quote). I have had superior support and service from my current agent for more than fourteen years and when their quotation was within $20 of the lowest competitive submission that made the decision quite easy.

My current agent is Karen Nobles of Valley Insurance Agency (630-232-1640) Their address is 422 E. State St., PO Box 231, Geneva, IL 60134.

If you are considering re-evaluating your personal property and casualty insurance, I would highly recommend that you give Karen a call.
