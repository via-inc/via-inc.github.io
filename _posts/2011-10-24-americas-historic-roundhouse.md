Gordy Hard is a great inspiration. He is still as passionate about Valley Insurance maybe even more so today than he was 30 years ago. It is that passion that makes his firm the best choice for your insurance needs. How do I know…?

It was 1980. I was a young man who along with my wife, had planned to open our first restaurant a 3,000 square foot facility, Ristorante Chianti, Geneva, IL. We had been approached by many insurance companies, but one young man who had recently ventured into his own business endeavor assisted by his wife, came better prepared than anyone else. When Gordy Hard presented me with his analysis of my insurance needs, I was totally impressed. I asked many questions and he had an equal number of answers.

When I gave the news to the other insurers that I had chose Gordy Hard and Valley Insurance, all of the others said the same thing “It’s a new company and he has no track record.” I simply replied “Thanks for the advice, but he seemed to really understand my business, my needs, had made the best presentation, had answers to my questions, and was reasonably priced.” And by the way didn’t they notice I, too, was a new company with no track record?”

Well, it is 2010. I am no longer a young man… my wife and I are in our 6th restaurant venture, all of which had Valley Insurance. We have grown from renting a 3,000 square foot facility to owning land, building and business in a 72,000 square foot facility, known as Walter Payton’s Roundhouse, Aurora, IL. We have been here 15 years, and yes the other not so young man whose wife still assists him, continues to visit us. We discuss my insurance needs (which are somewhat more complicated than my original policy in 1980). I still have questions… he still has answers… and his preparation and presentations are still far superior to any other agents who are still trying to get our business, 30 years later.
