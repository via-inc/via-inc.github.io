After many years at sea the pirate decided to retire. Since he had suffered injuries on the job he thought that he should collect on his workers compensation insurance. He had a looden leg, a hook where his right hand should be and a patch over his right eye. The agent assured him that he would be compensated if the injuries were work related. “How did you get the wooden leg?”

In a booming voice the pirate replied: “me and me mates were on the high seas when the boom she swang ‘round and knocked me into the sea where a shark bit off me leg.”

Agent: “That is certainly work related. How did you lose your hand?”

Pirate: “Well matey, me and me mates were on the high seas when the boo she swang ‘round and knocked me into the sea where a shark bit of me hand.”

Agent: “That is also worked related. How did you lose your eye?”

In a booming voice the pirate replied: “Well matey, I was laying on the deck one balmy day catching some rays when this seagull flew by and dropped his duty right in me eye!”

Agent: “What does that have to do with the loss of your eve?”

Pirate: “It were the first day with me hook!”
