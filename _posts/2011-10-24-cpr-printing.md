We are extremely happy with the service that we have always received from Valley Insurance. A year ago, we had a fire that destroyed our business on a Friday night and Gordie was there the next morning assessing the damage. Luckily, he had made sure that the coverage we had was adequate enough to replace everything that was lost. He helped us every step of the way. After the fire we heard from so many people that warned us that it was going to be a long, difficult road dealing with all of the different insurance issues but Gordie and Valley Insurance made it so easy. You don’t realize how important it is to have a really good insurance agent behind you until you’re standing there watching everything you’ve worked for burn down.
