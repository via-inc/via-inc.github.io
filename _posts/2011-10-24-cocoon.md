I have been with Valley Insurance Agency for 15 years and have always been extremely satisfied with their service and commitment to small business. As a local shop owner, insurance can be an inconvenience to deal with, but Gordie and Co. make the task smooth sailing!

Gordie and Kathleen and the Valley Insurance group are also incredibly active in the community and are always willing to lend a hand. Two thumbs up!
