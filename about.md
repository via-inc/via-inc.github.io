## Our History

Valley Insurance Agency was established in 1978 by Gordon Hard and initially located in Batavia, Illinois. We eventually relocated our offices to downtown Geneva in 1985 and moved to our current location in 1989. For over 35 years, Valley Insurance has provided a variety of insurance products and services, along with experienced, knowledgeable personnel, dedicated to assisting you in protecting your assets and liabilities.
Valley Insurance is committed to building close client relationships for the long term. We value the trust and confidence that we have established with our clients. As we celebrate our 35th anniversary in the insurance industry, we look forward to providing quality insurance at the best and equitable pricing, for many years to come.

As a Professional Independent Insurance Agency of Illinois we promise to provide you with coverage options from the country’s best insurance companies, not just one. We promise to stand up for your rights, because we work for you—not an insurance company. We promise to provide the best possible price for you insurance coverage’s. We promise to research coverage options and offer the bet insurance tailored specifically to fit your changing needs. Our focus on continuing education for our staff ensures that we stay abreast of every new development in the insurance industry, enabling us to provide the excellent level of service you deserve. We also believe in having a strong affiliation with the surrounding community. We have been a member of The Geneva Chamber of Commerce since 1985 and Gordon Hard was Past President from 1988-1998.

We look forward to the journey ahead and would like to remind you that: “Excellence isn’t our Goal - It’s our Standard!”
